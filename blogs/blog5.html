    <h2>Exploring Python Turtle: My Beginner Projects</h2>
    <p><em>Posted on July 2, 2025</em></p>

    <p>When I was just getting started with Python, I wanted something that would show results on the screen — not just numbers in the console. That’s when I discovered the <strong>Turtle module</strong>. It was the perfect way to mix fun with learning.</p>

    <p>I created a GitHub repository to collect all my beginner-friendly turtle projects in one place. These programs are simple but rewarding — they helped me understand loops, functions, angles, event handling, and basic logic.</p>

    <h3>What's in the Repo?</h3>
    <p>The repo contains a growing collection of Python turtle programs, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drawing dashed lines</strong> — using loops and pen control</li>
      <li><strong>Random walk</strong> — where the turtle randomly moves in different directions with colors</li>
      <li><strong>Clockwise and anti-clockwise movement</strong> — user-controlled turtle using key bindings</li>
      <li><strong>Spiral patterns</strong> — using angles and repetition</li>
      <li><strong>Simple shapes</strong> — squares, triangles, circles, polygons</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every file is beginner-friendly, well-commented, and meant to be modified. You can tweak angles, colors, and movement to make your own versions.</p>

    <h3>Why Turtle?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Instant visual feedback — great for beginners</li>
      <li>Teaches loops, functions, angles, and basic geometry</li>
      <li>Makes coding feel creative and playful</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>How to use the <code>turtle</code> module for drawing</li>
      <li>How to bind keyboard events with functions</li>
      <li>How to organize small programs using functions and control flow</li>
      <li>The joy of visual output when learning programming</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What’s Next</h3>
    <p>I'm planning to expand this with more advanced turtle projects — like spirographs, user-interactive drawing boards, and maybe even games. I also want to clean the structure and add a README for each project.</p>
